This is a plugin that provides an Open API reference for Better Auth. It shows all endpoints added by plugins and the core. It also provides a way to test the endpoints. It uses [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) to display the Open API reference.

    import { openAPI } from "better-auth/plugins"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            openAPI(), // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
